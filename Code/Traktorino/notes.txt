NOTES

Traktorino branch for use with an Arduino Mega (for Underdog Mod Shop's Mega Traktorino)

Uses a heavily modified Muliplexer4067 library, hardcoded to use pins 4, 5, 6, 7
so that the digitalWriteFast library can be used to speed things up significantly

REQUIRES the digitalWriteFast library be installed https://github.com/NicksonYap/digitalWriteFast

Traktorino branch that adds support for buttons and potentiometers on an add-on 4067 multiplexer

An additional multiplexer can be added to the Traktorino via broken-out mux pins at the bottom of the PCB.
Pins 10, 11, 14, and 13 correspond to the address lines on the 4067 mux, e.g. S0, S1, S2, and S3, respectively.
